    <h2>Description</h2>

    This recipe for venison Sloppy Joes comes from my friend who is a guide in Alaska. It's excellent for sandwiches on
    rolls with sharp Cheddar cheese. Yum yum!
    It's slow-cooked in a slow cooker so even the toughest of roasts or stew meats will work; eventually the meat just
    falls apart! It's also good served over hot
    cooked rice.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>¼ pound bacon</li>
        <li>2 pounds venison stew meat</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared Dijon-style mustard</li>
        <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over over medium-high heat until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove
            from the skillet, crumble and set aside. Brown stew meat in bacon grease for flavor.</li>
        <li>Put onion, brown sugar, vinegar, cumin, chili powder, garlic, mustard, ketchup, salt, and pepper in slow
            cooker and mix well. Add bacon and venison and stir together.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low for at least 8 hours. Use a fork to separate the meat into a thick and yummy Sloppy Joe-style
            barbecue.</li>
    </ul>
